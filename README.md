# [Project Name] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Puttu Biryani


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Rama - Aisat


### Project Description
Corngame is a chaotic desktop prank where your keyboard keys are shuffled randomly, a floating corn stalk dances in the background, and the Pink Panther theme sets the vibe. Your only way out is to decode a mysterious phrase‚Äîor suffer.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever felt too productive or too focused? We believe that‚Äôs the problem. Brains shouldn‚Äôt be at peace when they can be confused for fun!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A surprise key-masher that scrambles your keyboard every few minutes, plays suspicious music, and displays mysterious quotes while corn slowly spins across your screen. True productivity killer. üåΩ
